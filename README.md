## How to Run ? 🤨

> 💡The terminal must be in the root folder of the project to perform these steps ...

<br/>

1. Install all dependecies with your favorive Node Packages Manager;

```bash
  yarn install # or npm install
```

2. After Install all dependencies, Run all tests using `test` script;

```bash
  yarn test # or npm run test
```

3. Then run the project into development mode using `dev` script;

```bash
  yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

> 💡 If you build the project you need to use `start` script to build project from dist folder.

<br/>

And done !! you are ready to code or test !! 🤩
